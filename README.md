This is a game I made in godot live on my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/protodrew) in just 4 hours. The current 0.1 build is what I made with no frills. I will be doing more streams over the coming week to add more things to the project.


the art assets used are in the [Pixel Art Metroidvania Asset Pack](https://o-lobster.itch.io/platformmetroidvania-pixel-art-asset-pack) by o-lobster
